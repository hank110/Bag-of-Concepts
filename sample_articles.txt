washington the u.s. supreme court on friday agreed to consider whether microsoft corp. msft o should have to pay damages overseas for infringing a speech recognition software patent owned by at&t inc. t n <br> the high court granted microsoft's petition to review an appeals court ruling that held at&t could seek royalties based on the foreign manufacture and sale of infringing software products <br> the microsoft at&t dispute is one of the most important patent cases that will come before the court this year and could determine the reach of u.s. patents overseas experts said <br> the case raises the question of how far downstream you can go in capturing damages in the chain of commerce said stephen maebius a patent lawyer with the firm foley & lardner llp. <br> at issue is a ruling last year that upheld a lower court decision that microsoft was liable for infringing an at&t patent for converting speech into computer code in copies of windows sold overseas <br> the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit said the world's largest software maker was liable for the unauthorized distribution of codec technology used to compress speech signals into data in copies of windows overseas <br> a year earlier microsoft settled most of the telephone company's outstanding claims and both agreed to appeal the unresolved issue over the distribution of the technology overseas for which microsoft said it was not liable <br> u.s. solicitor general paul clement of the justice department urged the high court to review the case in a brief filed earlier with the court he agreed with much of microsoft's argument and said the appeals court ruling improperly extends united states patent law to foreign markets and puts u.s. software companies at a competitive disadvantage <br> that disadvantage will harm the software sector of the american economy and could ultimately compel some software companies to relocate their research and development operations abroad the government said in documents filed with the court <br> maebius said patent holders are trying to stretch the distance of a u.s. patent to perhaps compensate for lack of patent protection in foreign countries <br> microsoft had argued unsuccessfully before the appeals court that liability should not extend to products sold overseas because software is not a product component under u.s. patent law and because copies of the software were made overseas rather than in the united states. <br> microsoft issued a statement on friday saying the case was not only important to microsoft but to the entire u.s. information technology industry <br> an at&t spokesman said the company expects the high court will handle the case in the normal course of business we look forward to their decision <br> the supreme court did not comment further on its decision to grant the review except to say that chief justice john roberts did not participate in the decision

los angeles hollywood reporter when metro goldwyn mayer ceo harry sloan gives visitors a tour of the studio's airy executive offices on the 14th floor of the mgm tower in century city he enjoys pointing out an antique document in one of the display cases the paper in question is the founding agreement that charlie chaplin mary pickford douglas fairbanks and director d.w. griffith signed in [%_Number_%] when they decided to take control of their careers by joining to create their own motion picture company the united artists corp. <br> until thursday that old contract appeared more a historical artifact than a template for the future but in announcing that it has struck a deal with tom cruise and his producing partner paula wagner to revive ua mgm said it was harkening back to ua's storied history as a filmmaker-friendly place where producers writers directors and actors can thrive in a creative environment <br> ua which has earned nine best picture oscars has occupied a unique if sometimes embattled spot in hollywood history and its legacy is remembered fondly <br> with that in mind producer david picker who worked at ua from 1956 73 heading production through most of that period hailed its newest incarnation saying knowing some of the films that paula and tom have encouraged it seems like an enlightened choice the industry could use a film company that works with filmmakers and can give them a sympathetic ear <br> as legend has it silent film stars chaplin pickford and fairbanks first began talking of creating their own company while traveling the country as part of a war bonds tour during world war i. with griffith joining the start up they each committed to making five movies annually an overly ambitious plan even given the accelerated production schedules of the silent era <br> the industry joke that immediately made the rounds was that the inmates have taken over the asylum in later years it would be attributed to chaplin himself though it is reported to have been coined by richard rowland co-founder of metro pictures with louis b. mayer. <br> ua's first decade saw the release of such movies as chaplin's the gold rush city lights and modern times" griffith's america" fairbanks the three musketeers and robin hood" and 1929's coquette which earned pickford the best actress oscar. with joseph schenck who later would co-found 20th century pictures serving as president ua also ventured into distribution and exhibition and worked with filmmakers ranging from samuel goldwyn to walt disney. <br> griffith quickly abandoned the venture with the coming of talkies pickford and fairbanks faded from the screen and chaplin scaled back his own efforts in its initial burst of success and gradual demise ua foreshadowed such other filmmaker-driven companies as first artists a partnership among sidney poitier barbra streisand paul newman and steve mcqueen in the late 60s and the directors company formed by peter bogdanovich francis ford coppola and william friedkin in the early 70s in each case the founding partners individual agendas simply did_not stay in sync for long <br> ua had become a shell of its former self when in 1951 new york-based entertainment attorneys arthur krim and robert benjamin proposed that they take over the company in exchange for an option to buy it if they could turn a profit within four years <br> under their leadership ua adopted a new model it did_not invest in developing a studio lot but instead financed movies with filmmakers many of who chose to shoot on location throughout the world who were given an unprecedented amount of freedom without meddlesome executives looking over their shoulders <br> the new ua attracted such filmmakers as producer sam spiegel and director john huston who turned out the african queen" hill hecht lancaster prods which produced the oscar-winning marty" and producer-director stanley kramer "judgment at nuremberg"). <br> by the 60s ua seemed to capture the swingin zeitgeist working with walter mirisch and the mirisch corp it turned out west side story and in the heat of the night as well as billy wilder's some like it hot and the apartment. it was tuned into the british new wave as well handling the beatles a hard day's night tony richardson's tom jones and john schlesinger's midnight cowboy and sunday bloody sunday. it discovered and nurtured such enormously popular franchises as the james bond adventures the pink panther series and the rocky movies <br> let's face it it was a simpler time we were in the movie business not the marketing business picker recalled the atmosphere that we created was one of creative freedom within the parameters of the budget although there were risks the numbers were a lot smaller then still it was a unique time in the industry at ua we abrogated our power and egos in favor of the filmmakers and the relations we developed with them <br> in 1967 krim and benjamin sold control of ua to san francisco-based transamerica corp an insurance and financial services company for a time all prospered in the mid 70s ua scored an oscar trifecta winning three best pictures in a row for one flew over the cuckoo's nest rocky and annie hall. eventually tiring of corporate oversight however krim and benjamin and their team exited in [%_Number_%] to form orion pictures. <br> gradually ua's fate had become intertwined with mgm's. it had taken over sales and distribution for mgm's films in 1973 and after a new management team allowed michael cimino's heaven's gate to escalate into a [%_Currency_%] million box office bomb transamerica tired of the movie business and sold the company to kirk kerkorian who merged it with mgm. <br> in recent years ua has had something of an identity crisis while briefly under the leadership of respected indie exec bingham ray it entered the specialty films arena with such films as michael moore's bowling for columbine and terry george's hotel rwanda. at the same time it appeared to be steering toward more popular genre fare with the legally blonde and jeepers creepers franchises <br> after mgm was sold to a consortium of investors in april 2005 ua was effectively put on the shelf ua films produced before the sale such as capote and art school confidential were released by sony pictures classics. a reminder of past glories the ua logo also adorns the upcoming sony pictures release casino royale which mgm co-produced with columbia pictures. <br> it now falls to cruise and wagner to see whether they can restore the ua name to its past glory by taking it back to the future <br> reuters hollywood reporter

new york investors often scrutinize insider stock sales for what they suggest about a company's prospects now researchers say there is evidence that corporations could be in for trouble when top executives cash out quickly <br> gradient analytics an independent research firm that looks closely at executive compensation says it has come up with a model that pinpoints instances in which corporate insiders exercise large caches of options abnormally early <br> the findings are significant for investors because they show a strong link between early exercise decisions and a subsequent deterioration of the company's profits and share price according to gradient founder carr bettis who has previously taught finance at arizona state university. <br> the research is based on a working paper bettis wrote with two other academic experts examining more than [%_Number_%] option exercises by corporate chief executives chairmen presidents and chief operating officers at [%_Number_%] companies from [%_Number_%] to [%_Number_%] <br> the study says executives appear to use private information of future earnings underperformance to time option exercises it found that the negative performance typically showed up six months after the early option exercise <br> using the ideas behind that study scottsdale arizona-based gradient has raised questions in reports to clients about past option exercise activity at companies such as software distributor red hat inc. rht n and retailer jos a. bank clothiers inc. josb o <br> both of those reports went out last year and shares of both companies fell in the months afterward gradient declined to provide any stock research reports on other companies from this year saying they are still being digested by its roster of clients including hedge funds and other investors <br> however we have had a rash of what we think are compelling signals of early exercise transactions over the last two months bettis said he said the phenomenon has been most noticeable in the technology sector which has traditionally doled out copious options to employees <br> harder line <br> the research comes as the u.s. securities and exchange commission and federal prosecutors are taking a hard look at corporate america's options practices especially awards that might have been backdated to give executives the chance to earn extra profit <br> there are also continuing questions about the overall trading practices of corporate insiders in a recent study stanford university assistant professor alan jagolinzer examined prearranged trading schedules known as 10b5 1 plans designed to allow insiders to trade when they do not possess material nonpublic information <br> jagolinzer's study found trades in the plans set up by an sec rule in 2000 outperformed the broader market although insiders are supposed to plan trades when not privately informed the study found the rule appeared to enable strategic trade <br> gradient's research on exercise decisions is based on mathematical forecasts looking at when insiders might normally want to unload some options factoring in sales to diversify a portfolio or because of a run-up in the share price <br> the model focuses on deep in the money options in which the current value of the company's shares is well above the option's exercise price these are particularly valuable options and earlier than projected exercises can raise red flags that bad news at the company might be about to hit bettis said when options are exercised the underlying shares are almost always immediately sold <br> what we found was that not only do these early deep in the money exercises result in share price declines over the period that follows but they also are associated with earnings misses and future misses bettis said <br> at red hat for example gradient issued a february [%_Number_%] report saying the volume of exercise activity at the time was the largest in the company's history and the principal concern was share-price risk in coming quarters <br> when the report was released red hat shares traded at nearly $27 but fell below [%_Currency_%] six months later they closed at [%_Currency_%] on thursday. <br> at jos a. bank gradient reported on march [%_Number_%] that a resurgence of early exercise of deep in the money options might indicate heightened risk of underperformance at the time shares traded at about [%_Currency_%] they were down to about [%_Currency_%] six months later and closed on thursday at $30.37. <br> neither red hat nor jos a. bank immediately responded to requests for comment <br> the theory doesn t always bear out in one case gradient suggested to clients in january [%_Number_%] that what it called abnormal exercise activity at smith international inc. sii n could be a bad omen for the stock shares have seesawed since the report which came out when the stock traded around [%_Currency_%] it climbed to nearly [%_Currency_%] six months later dipped below [%_Currency_%] in september and closed on thursday at $39 26 about flat with a year ago <br> we looked at it as a case that did_not work out as expected bettis said <br> a smith international representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment <br> gradient says insider selling is one of more than a dozen factors its analysts sift through when assessing a stock and that it shouldn t be looked at in a vacuum other experts also suggest viewing insider sales in a broader context <br> it is valuable information said nejat seyhun a university of michigan finance professor who studies insider transactions but i wouldn t base my entire trading strategy on whether insiders bought or sold

immokalee florida a coalition of migrant farmworkers is taking its fight against wages that leave u.s. tomato pickers in deep poverty to the home of mcdonald's corp the world's largest restaurant company <br> the coalition of immokalee workers comprised mostly of mexican and guatemalan immigrants and based in this hardscrabble town in the middle of south florida's farm country came to prominence in the 1990s by exposing a series of farmworker abuse and human trafficking cases <br> the group's real claim to fame came in march 2005 however when it won an unlikely agreement with fast-food chain taco bell and its parent yum brands to pay a penny more per pound of tomatoes <br> yum agreed to the hike after a four-year boycott but coalition leaders hope to avoid such a stiff fight in the case of mcdonald's. instead they say high-profile protests like two planned for next month coupled with mcdonald's brand recognition and often repeated adherence to corporate responsibility will shame it into matching the yum deal <br> if the coalition gets a so-called pattern agreement with the undisputed u.s. fast-food king the hope is that the whole fast food industry will follow giving a big boost to workers whose wages have essentially been stagnant for [%_Number_%] years <br> this could create a domino effect coalition activist gerardo reyes a 29 year old native of zacatecas mexico told reuters in a recent interview <br> it could be the trigger that puts the whole fast-food industry in motion said reyes. <br> on april 13 the coalition will stage demonstrations outside mcdonald's corporate headquarters in oak brook illinois. a day later it will lead a march through downtown chicago culminating in a rally under the golden arches at mcdonald's flagship restaurant in the windy city. <br> a lot of people are organizing this said reyes. it is going to be a very big crowd <br> [%_Number_%] percent solution <br> a penny a pound increase for tomatoes may seem like chump change for burger behemoth mcdonald's. the hike could make a big difference for the tomato pickers of florida however the state which has a long history of miserable conditions for farmworkers is the source of more than [%_Number_%] percent of the fresh winter tomatoes produced in the united states. <br> largely working on small individually owned farms tomato pickers are currently paid about [%_Number_%] cents for every 32 pound 14 5 kg bucket of the fruit they pick with no rights to overtime pay or any other job benefits a penny more for each bucket would raise the pay rate to [%_Number_%] cents handing the workers a hefty 71 percent increase in wages <br> at the current wage rate a worker has to pick nearly [%_Number_%] tons of tomatoes daily to make [%_Currency_%] or harvest [%_Number_%] pounds to be able to afford a big mac sandwich at a miami mcdonald's. the coalition says a reasonable worker can pick about [%_Number_%] tons of tomatoes on a good day <br> what we re asking for is possible because taco bell is already doing it and it works said reyes. it is only fair because every worker has the right to a decent wage taco bell has said the pay increase costs it just [%_Currency_%] a year <br> mcdonald's declined to comment on the coalition's demands saying only in a statement that it was an advocate for working with suppliers and producers to help improve the standards for florida's tomato workers <br> while actively seeking to bring this about the statement added that suppliers need to demonstrate plans to improve and enhance the economic welfare of farm workers who pick tomatoes for mcdonald's. <br> a study commissioned by mcdonald's last year found that florida's tomato pickers earned a wage of up [%_Currency_%] per hour at one grower's florida farm <br> the study has been widely criticized as inaccurate in a state where median farmworker income was [%_Currency_%] per hour in [%_Number_%] in order to achieve it a worker would also have to pick [%_Number_%] pounds 589 kg of tomatoes more than half a ton per hour <br> but it was cited by mcdonald's rival burger king corp. last week as a reason for rejecting the call for a penny per pound increase <br> what seems so odd is that burger king is now resurrecting a totally discredited study said bruce nissen director of the research institute on social and economic policy at florida international university.

windsor ontario the canada-u.s. border stretches a full [%_Number_%] km 5 525 miles touches three oceans and is a crossing point for a trading relationship worth c$1 6 billion $1 4 billion a day <br> but with much of the trade dependent on just a few key crossings linking the northeastern united states to the manufacturing hub of ontario canadian producers say security-related delays and creaking infrastructure are costing both countries billions of dollars each year <br> lines have long been a problem at ontario crossings particularly as trade has ballooned in the wake of the [%_Number_%] canada-u.s. free trade agreement <br> but since the september 11 2001 attacks on new york and washington traffic has slowed even more as u.s. officials have toughened screening pressuring a relationship that relies heavily on just in time deliveries to manufacturers <br> that border now has become more of a choke point rather than a conduit for trade said len crispino chief executive of the ontario chamber of commerce which estimates canada loses as much as c$8 billion every year to border delays <br> with the great lakes system separating canada's main manufacturing centers in ontario from neighboring u.s. states heavy pressure is put on crossings such as the ambassador bridge often called the busiest border crossing in the world <br> linking the southern ontario city of windsor with the auto hub of detroit the bridge carries about one quarter of the entire trade between the two countries linking suppliers and customers whose production can be held hostage to slowdowns <br> the problem is that since we re so integrated that somebody exporting from the windsor area probably has [%_Number_%] percent of the components build elsewhere in canada. there is a kind of trickle effect said crispino. <br> the trade is also key to the u.s. economy but over the past five years it has been obscured by worries that canada could be used as a staging ground for extremists planning attacks on the united states. <br> these worries have been stoked by incidents such as the [%_Number_%] arrest of one-time montreal resident ahmed ressam who was later convicted of plotting to bomb los angeles airport as well as the arrest [%_Number_%] suspected terror cell members near toronto last year <br> former u.s. ambassador to canada paul celluci said in [%_Number_%] that security trumps trade" and truck drivers who make their living hauling cargo across the border say that is indeed the case as scrutiny of both cargo and the drivers themselves can turn a short border crossing into a money-losing nightmare <br> it can be [%_Number_%] hours or it can be [%_Number_%] minutes said eric serre a private trucker based in london ontario. <br> it can go pretty smoothly one time and then the next time it will be enough to convince you to never do it again <br> lost lunch <br> the nature of the delays can range from the annoying to the humiliating as a directive implemented last year led to food confiscation from truckers carrying certain meats and fruits a hardship for drivers who live in their rigs during long trips <br> last month canadian public safety minister stockwell day unveiled a c$431 6 million spending plan to help ease delays with the centerpiece a system called e-manifest to allow drivers to send their cargo lists electronically to the border before they arrive <br> a similar plan is in place in the united states just the latest of a string of initiatives on both sides meant to relieve border congestion by forcing transporters to get pre-clearance on their cargo <br> the initiatives help to some degree transporters say but they are not well co-ordinated with each other and they also pose a new set of burdens on truckers who must pay extra fees and often wade through red tape to get documents in order <br> on a crisp february afternoon the ambassador bridge is largely free of passenger traffic yet the trucks are stacked

the heavier traffic is heading toward the united states a fact some say is made worse by infrastructure on the canadian side <br> truckers point to a lack of a direct freeway link to the bridge as highway [%_Number_%] ontario's main east-west freeway ends several kilometres miles before the bridge forcing truckers to enter city traffic that can jam them up for hours <br> plans are in the works to build a second span for the bridge but that likely will not be in place until [%_Number_%] <br> lurking in everyone's mind is the fear of what would happen if a major security scare closed the

consultations with finance minister jim flaherty to press the need for more spending on border infrastructure <br> a delegation from her group was also in washington a few weeks a go to push their

sydney an insider trading case starting on monday against citigroup c n is not aimed at preventing investment banks from proprietary trading in the shares of a client's takeover target australian regulators say <br> the case which is being closely watched internationally deals with how investment banks separate their trading and merger advisory businesses and centers on a chat between two traders <br> authorities allege a brief conversation on a sydney street led a citigroup trader to believe his firm was involved in the a$6 3 billion $5 1 billion takeover of stevedoring firm patrick by rival toll holdings ltd. tol ax in [%_Number_%] <br> the trader then in possession of inside information says the australian securities and investments commission asic sold a parcel of patrick shares later that day breaching insider trading laws <br> asic has charged citigroup australia with two insider trading offences and a series of conflict of interest charges relating to trades in port-cargo handler patrick. <br> the regulator said in its opening statement already registered with the federal court in sydney that investment banks are entitled to proprietary trading trading on their own behalf as long as they have their client's permission <br> if the informed consent of the client to that trading is obtained no difficulty will arise said the asic statement obtained from citigroup. <br> without such informed consent a bank is likely to run into a series of rapidly evolving conflicts of interest said <br> asic. <br> the charges are civil not criminal and no individuals have been charged citigroup australia has rejected the charges and said its chinese walls internal barriers to secure confidential information were not breached <br> citigroup has said it believes the australian regulator wants to prevent investment banks from proprietary trading from the date they accept an advisory mandate with a client <br> citigroup chief executive chuck prince has worked in recent years to reform business practices and ethics after a series of scandals cost the bank billions of dollars and alarmed regulators <br> the bank agreed to pay [%_Currency_%] billion to settle lawsuits over its roles in the collapses of enron corp. and worldcom inc and was fined over a multi billion euro bond trade in [%_Number_%] <br> citigroup australia advised on corporate takeovers worth about [%_Currency_%] billion last year making it australia's fourth busiest deal broker according to data compiler dealogic. <br> citigroup rejects charges <br> in an earlier statement to the court asic said citigroup conducted insider trading on august 19 [%_Number_%] when a trader bought [%_Number_%] million patrick shares but later sold patrick shares after being told by his boss to stop trading in patrick. <br> citigroup in its opening statement said the trader was told to stop buying patrick shares but rejected the insider trading charges adding the trader had denied making the assumption that citigroup was acting for toll in a takeover of patrick. <br> it also said that if the trader had inside information on a takeover target he would have bought not sold shares <br> it would be counter productive to sell some shares but that is the substance of the first insider trading claim citigroup said in its statement <br> asic and citigroup also disagree on whether citigroup had a fiduciary duty to toll at the time of the proprietary trading <br> asic said citigroup had a fiduciary duty to its client toll and its failure to inform toll of its proprietary trading was misleading and deceptive <br> citigroup was obliged not to allow itself to be placed in positions of actual or potential conflict the existence of those conflicts shows that citigroup did not have adequate arrangements in place to prevent the conflicts from arising asic said <br> asic said citigroup's failure to get toll's consent to trade in patrick shares led to its chinese walls being breached and insider trading occurring <br> the vice of insider trading lies not only in its nature as such but as a very real manifestation of the difficulties of proprietary trading in the target of a client without first having obtained the client's consent said asic. <br> $1=a$1 24

new york blackstone's pending $4 billion initial public offering may be tempting for individual investors but shareholders beware the firm's growth will be tough to maintain and its business difficult to grasp ipo analysts said on friday. <br> blackstone a new york-based private investment fund and advisory firm filed on thursday to take around [%_Number_%] percent of itself public the filing was a landmark event as blackstone is the only major u.s. private equity firm to offer a piece of its general partnership to the public <br> the offering will allow both financial institutions and individual investors in the united states a piece of the blackstone holdings ipo with a new york stock exchange listing planned to come in the next [%_Number_%] days sources close to the process say <br> that differs from other offerings issued by such u.s. private equity firms as kohlberg kravis roberts & co. and apollo management which listed public overseas that were limited to certain investors <br> thanks to a few huge blackstone deals the [%_Currency_%] billion buyout of equity office properties trust among them and a thriving private equity climate seizing headlines individual investors are likely to clamor for blackstone shares <br> yet some analysts cautioned that although the firm's success is tough to dispute the ability to maintain its sky-rocketing growth is less clear <br> their growth is outstanding but the law of large numbers is going to catch up with them said francis gaskins an independent ipo analyst and president of ipo desktop. blackstone can_not continue to be number one forever <br> net income grew by roughly [%_Number_%] percent last year to [%_Currency_%] billion revenue from fund and advisory fees grew [%_Number_%] percent to [%_Currency_%] billion according to thursday's filing <br> another issue for investors to chew on is the offering's structure built as a master limited partnership that gives shareholders units of the partnership and limits shareholder say the partnership keeps much of the firm's actions in the private realm and does not require an annual meeting for shareholders compensation is determined by top executives not a committee <br> for more on the structure please click on <id:nn22271469>. <br> another thing for investors to consider is that blackstone's ceo stephen schwarzman has disparaged the public markets saying they are over rated that has left some on wall street to wonder if the blackstone ipo is meant more for schwarzman and other top executives to use the equity generated to cash-out at the top as the private equity market nears its peak <br> the filing says that [%_Number_%] percent of the units received by schwarzman will be fully vested on the date of issuance with the remaining [%_Number_%] percent vesting in equal installments for four years <br> still another issue for retail investors understanding blackstone's business <br> the firm offers corporate m&a advisory but also invests a broad range of global funds spanning private equity hedge funds hedge fund of funds mutual funds and debt <br> it is best known for its private equity practice in which they borrow huge amounts of capital through takeover targets to finance acquisitions blackstone's private equity practice generated [%_Currency_%] billion of income before taxes last year the most of any of its branches the filing says <br> that is a big figure but understanding how they got there is another thing for an individual investor said scott sweet managing director for ipo research firm ipoboutique.com. <br> the creative financing aspect of putting together a major deal worth billions involves debt cash and other instruments and that will be the hardest for the average retail investor to understand sweet said <br> estimating a price of blackstone's ipo is nearly impossible as that is determined by the underwriters and the firm people involved in the process are extremely tight-lipped about the possible opening price <br> blackstone and the main underwriters morgan stanley and citigroup declined to comment about the offering on friday.

richmond virginia richmond federal reserve bank president jeffrey lacker said on thursday the risks of disappointingly modest economic growth had mounted but getting inflation lower was still his main concern <br> in the last three to six months the downside risks have definitely crept up at the same time the longer we go on without a noteworthy decline in inflation the more the risk we run of entrenching expectations where they are now he told reporters after addressing local economists <br> asked if he felt the current setting of interest rates was sufficient to bring inflation down at a fast-enough pace he made plain he would be patient for a while <br> the question in that regard will arise later in the year if as i anticipate the downside risks ease significantly <br> i think at that point there will be a policy question in front of us about inflation because if inflation has not moderated by then and the downside risks ease and we get by the housing slowdown then the choice is going to face us squarely he said <br> lacker who is not a voting member of the fed's policy-setting committee this year is one of the u.s. central bank's most hawkish members he dissented at four consecutive policy meetings last year seeking higher interest rates when the fed held benchmark rates steady <br> there are some fears that problems in the subprime mortgage market which provides loans for borrowers with tainted credit could spread and hurt the overall economy but lacker played these down <br> i do_not see it as a big risk to growth or housing at the margin increasing spreads are going to mean some people who would otherwise be homeowners would be renters instead <br> lacker's speech focused on inflation expectations and he emphasized central banks must not take anything for granted <br> this apparent stability relative to the wide swings inflation expectations displayed in prior decades should not be cause for complacency particularly with inflation running uncomfortably high he said <br> central banks should not take inflation expectations for granted by acting in ways that are inconsistent with expectations but assuming expectations will not change lacker told the virginia association of economists.

washington here is a multiple-choice question for savers and investors what is a more frightening prospect now inflation or recession <br> the answer of course is both accelerating prices and a [%_GRADE_%] or no-growth economy is a killer combo that's been called stagflation since the 1960s and it is not fun <br> folks of a certain age might remember the stagflation which dominated the u.s. economy in the 1970s it was a gloomy time when energy prices and gasoline lines dominated the news when whole industries slumped at the same time and when job losses and price hikes seemed to travel in tandem <br> now some federal reserve-watchers are suggesting we re facing another bout of the same malaise <br> remarks in the fed's latest policy statement just scream stagflation writes investment blogger tim iacono. the fed's stagflation dilemma is getting tougher according to another economic story the word stagflation was mentioned some [%_Number_%] times in recent blog postings according to online monitor technorati.com. <br> it is easy to see where the concerns come from on the recession side there is the housing slump the worsening mortgage market the continued loss of jobs to lower-paid workers in developing countries and as circuit city recently proved with [%_Number_%] pay-related layoffs right here at home pay raises have been blah for several years running if you are looking for inflation signs you need look no further than february's [%_Number_%] percent gain in producer prices and [%_Number_%] percent rise in consumer prices but you can look at the accelerating price of manufacturing supplies reported by companies across many industries in the institute for supply management. or just check what you are paying for health care college tuition gasoline or that monthly mortgage <br> these economic trends are worrisome though there are some reasons not to fear a recurrence of the 70s interest rates are starting much lower and the fed's fear of inflation borders on paranoia slow wage growth and jobs should hold prices down too the 1970s forces which really pushed markets over the top an oil embargo and a private family's cornering of the silver market are not in evidence now and even homeowners who have seen home prices slide recently are still sitting on a lot of equity the easy-money credit markets could keep consumers bolstering demand and most importantly things never happen exactly the same way twice <br> but things do fall apart in ever different ways so it makes sense to position yourself for all of the above without going overboard here are some pointers <br> do_not go overboard overboard behaviors include selling all of your stocks bonds and your house and putting the money into gold palladium art or any other commodity that doesn t pay dividends or interest or have earnings <br> worry about yourself first collectively consumers do need to continue spending to keep the economy on the move but it is probably better for your own finances to shirk this responsibility for a while reign in spending and start paying off credit card balances and other bills in the biggest chunks possible <br> organize your debts stagflation the last time around saw interest rates rising to usurious levels use the time you have now to lock in decent fixed-rate mortgages transfer balances to low-rate cards or use other loan products on the market to keep your debts manageable and stable <br> stay invested and diversified stocks may not be great every year but as long-term places to keep money they beat bonds gold and shoeboxes all to heck keep your retirement fund in a mix of stocks foreign stocks bonds and more even if bad times come spreading your money around will moderate the impact on you <br> keep an inflation kicker mining stocks inflation bonds real estate investment funds natural resources mutual funds all have different pros and cons but you will be happy with any of them if we do undergo a period of runaway inflation keep a corner of your portfolio reserved for this typically that's no more than [%_Number_%] percent <br> invest in yourself you may not be able to count on your salary going up in tandem with the costs of running your life but the right computer management or language course could position you for a better and better paying job down the road <br> save money the worst part of stagflation is that it makes it harder and harder to save any money but do what you can the more cash you have to call upon in an emergency the less desperate or destitute you will have to be if those [%_Number_%] bloggers turn out to be right

philadelphia general electric co. ge n should spin off its nbc and ge money units and its real estate assets to unlock value in the core company citigroup analyst jeffrey sprague said on friday. <br> as a stand-alone company nbc would be better able to explore acquisitions or sell itself to a larger media company he said <br> ge stock has basically gone sideways for five years despite solid underlying execution sprague said in a research report we believe ge's size and complexity is working against investor interest in the stock and has contributed to further valuation erosion <br> the company's stock rose [%_Number_%] percent to [%_Currency_%] in early trading on the new york stock exchange. <br> ge the world's second-largest company by market capitalization behind exxon mobil corp. xom n has diverse operations ranging from manufacturing jet engines to commercial lending to nbc media <br> sprague said that after spinning off ill-fitting businesses a new leaner ge would have [%_Number_%] earnings of about [%_Currency_%] billion or [%_Currency_%] per share at a valuation of [%_Number_%] times estimated earnings ge could trade at [%_Currency_%] to [%_Currency_%] per share he said while the pieces to be spun off could have a collective value of [%_Currency_%] to [%_Currency_%] per share <br> we believe a total value above [%_Currency_%] could be achieved given the possibility of a higher multiple on the new core company or takeover premiums on the spun-off pieces sprague said <br> sprague said ge's complex structure has been a distraction and that spinning off the units would create a more focused company that investors could more easily understand <br> the new smaller ge would still be a [%_Currency_%] billion 2007 estimated sales giant that would continue to enjoy the size and scope benefits that are integral to its global competitive advantages today he said <br> earlier this week ge chief executive jeff immelt said he found the lagging performance of the company's shares versus major u.s. indexes frustrating <br> is it frustrating sure it is but the thing investors will always respond to is consistent earnings growth he told reporters before the company's annual meeting on wednesday. <br> immelt became ceo in september [%_Number_%] <br> we believe ceo immelt and team have done an excellent job playing the hand they were dealt sprague said nevertheless the stock has chronically underperformed and at the end of the day ge has to deliver shareholder returns <br> in the face of limited movement in the stock some investors have said they would like to see ge accelerate the pace of stock buybacks or find other ways to return equity to shareholders <br> ge weathers storms better as a whole <br> despite sprague's call for ge to break apart other analysts have previously argued that ge's breadth and international exposure should enable it to ride out any slowdown in the u.s. economy and take advantage of a weaker dollar <br> the story this year is going to be a weak domestic economy driven by weakness in housing and automotive and so forth and growth abroad it is all about international exposure said shawn campbell principal with chicago-based campbell asset management which owns ge shares <br> campbell said the cry to split apart ge is just another fad in the wall street cycle of trends <br> you get through these periods where it is like get big have a diversified portfolio buy all these things you go on this m&a spree campbell said when that plays out and there is no one left to buy then you say diversification getting big that's not what you want to do what you really need to do is break up and focus <br> richard steinberg president of steinberg global asset management a boca raton florida-based asset management firm that owns about [%_Number_%] ge shares called citigroup's research report the classic conglomerate discount research piece <br> this piece is long overdue i do_not think it will come to anything it shows that there are parts of the business that get tougher for ge to decide what becomes fuel for growth and what becomes engines of growth steinberg said <br> management is aware that the underperformance has been an issue but i do_not get a sense that they will feel the pressure to break the company up steinberg said <br> sprague acknowledged in his report that there are no signs that ge has any plans to pursue a break up but he said he thinks shareholder pressure will intensify <br> sum of the parts <br> we have always held the view that ge is greater than its sum of the parts because it leverages people capital and vertical market expertise well sprague said however we also believe that certain pieces of the portfolio really do_not fit per se and if exited could create upside for the remaining ge and spun-off pieces <br> the recent lagging performance at nbc has been a distraction to ge as a whole sprague said as an independent business nbc could pursue acquisitions or sell itself to a larger media entity <br> ge money a financing and lending business earns about [%_Number_%] percent of its earnings internationally as an independent company it could pursue more aggressive growth than it can now he said <br> ge real estate holds more than [%_Currency_%] billion in assets which sprague described as a nice stand alone business the unit benefits from strong management but a spinoff could be complicated by whether or not the business could be converted into a real estate investment trust structure <br> additional reporting by ben klayman in chicago

<br> there are as many as [%_Number_%] million family-controlled businesses in the united states employing an estimated [%_Number_%] percent of the u.s. work force some [%_Number_%] percent of the fortune [%_Number_%] is family controlled according to the center for family business at northeastern university in boston. <br> but only about one in three family businesses passes successfully to the second generation by the fourth generation just [%_Number_%] percent are still family run <br> succession is becoming an even bigger issue now as baby boomers near retirement a [%_Number_%] survey by massachusetts mutual life insurance co. and the raymond family business institute found that [%_Number_%] percent of family businesses expected to change leadership within five years as chief executives step down <br> st. thomas's opus college of business in minneapolis expects growing corporate backlash to drive more people to family business noting that [%_Number_%] ceos left their jobs in [%_Number_%] twice as many as in the previous year <br> those are some of the reasons why the school is incorporating lessons on family business throughout its business curriculum parents are expected to come for just the one class however <br> role reversal <br> the university also sees the focus as a way to stand out in a crowd of better-known business schools that typically stress teaching generally accepted accounting principles or how to navigate sarbanes-oxley rules for publicly traded companies <br> monson's students learn those things too but they also get into tough topics such as how to tell an aging parent it is time to step aside and let the next generation take over <br> it is an interesting time of life for the students he said how do you establish credibility in the business world and oh by the way how do you transform your relationship with mom and dad from parent-child to adult adult? <br> barbara spector editor of family business magazine based in philadelphia said very few business schools have given family enterprise the attention it deserves <br> institutions mistakenly believe that all family businesses are mom and pop she said rattling off a list of family-dominated mega-corporations that includes wal-mart stores inc.. <br> that attitude has started to change in recent years as universities recognize the economic contribution of family businesses spector said more than [%_Number_%] universities now have family business centers but monson said his is the only known family business class designed for parents and children <br> the concept of having parents attend college classes with their kids is a great idea said don schwerzler founder of business consulting firm family business institute in atlanta. <br> one can learn about business strategies in a classroom setting but learning about the sacrifices that parents make in trying to create a successful family business a successful family legacy are the kinds of stories that will benefit all in attendance he said <br> reverse snobbery <br> wayne rivers co-founder and president of the raleigh north carolina family business institute sees a form of reverse snobbery among younger family businesses leaders who look at entrepreneurs such as bill gates who dropped out of college and think a traditional mba makes little sense <br> most business schools teach you how to quantify things and how to make dispassionate business decisions and how to analyze situations properly he said <br> they give you all kinds of great tools but they do_not teach any of the practical tools that people need to get ahead especially if they are entrepreneurs <br> if they focused more on time management goal-setting or strategic planning for family business the schools might attract more students from business-owning families he said <br> academic research on family business is limited but the few studies out there suggest that they are generally more profitable than public companies st. thomas's monson said one study shows that initial public offerings of family-owned companies tend to outperform non-family businesses <br> the reasons are not entirely clear which is why monson and others are pushing for more academic research but family businesses tend to invest more patiently than public companies that are beholden to quarterly earnings reports and they emphasize ethics and relationship building <br> monson stresses that he doesn t have anything against public companies if opus graduates prefer wall street or a public company to the family business that's fine too but he hopes they come away with a strong sense of ethics and a desire to do good rather than just maximize profit at all cost

new york u.s. interest rates are appropriate for the federal reserve to achieve its goals but may need to be re-evaluated later this year a top fed official said on tuesday. <br> the fed has kept the benchmark federal funds rate steady at [%_Number_%] percent since last june to bring inflation down as economic growth slows but it has said that inflation remained its predominant concern <br> richmond federal reserve president jeffrey lacker who is regarded as one of fed's more hawkish officials said he was comfortable with rates <br> the current funds rate has us on track to achieve what we want he told reporters after a speech to the money marketeers of new york university. so i am comfortable with where the funds rate is now but circumstances change later this year they will have to be re evaluated <br> lacker who is not a voting member of the u.s. central bank's interest rate-setting committee in 2007 dissented at four consecutive fed meetings last year in favor of another quarter percentage point rate hike <br> although he considers rates appropriate for now he made plain in a cnbc interview earlier that inflation was a concern <br> core inflation has been fluctuating between [%_Number_%] and 2 ½ percent for two years now since april [%_Number_%] before that from [%_Number_%] until 2003 core inflation went between [%_Number_%] and [%_Number_%] percent we need to get back to containing core inflation between [%_Number_%] and [%_Number_%] percent he told cnbc. <br> core inflation strips out volatile food and energy prices to yield a more reliable measure underlying price pressures <br> the fact that inflation expectations seem to have risen as inflation has risen and seem to be lodged around [%_Number_%] percent gives me a lot of concern he said <br> the national association for business economics forecast the core personal consumption expenditures index pce the fed's favored measure for underlying prices would average [%_Number_%] percent this year <br> fed chairman ben bernanke speaking in washington did not comment on the economy or interest rates in text prepared for an awards ceremony <br> growth returning to trend <br> in his speech lacker said u.s. economic growth should be below trend in the first half of [%_Number_%] before returning to trend by the end of the year growth slipped to an annualized [%_Number_%] percent in the opening three months of this year its weakest pace in four years <br> the housing market is likely to find a bottom some time this year and no longer be a drag on top line growth business investment will pick up and consumer spending will remain healthy he said <br> many economists think long-term u.s. trend growth lies around [%_Number_%] percent <br> lacker doubted high gasoline prices heading into the u.s. summer driving season would change the growth outlook but he said they could impact consumer inflation expectations <br> i am worried that there will be an uptick in inflation expectations as a result of retail gas prices going up and that will get built into prices going forward he said on cnbc. <br> he said in his speech that the inflation outlook hinged on policy makers ability to influence inflation expectations <br> using interest rates alone to manage expectations would be difficult and time consuming <br> my sense is that clear communications accompanied by consistent actions could bring about a relatively prompt and low-cost reduction in inflation he said <br> lacker reiterated that the fed should adopt an explicit inflation target which is under discussion at the central bank and is expected to be looked at again at meetings on june [%_Number_%] and [%_Number_%] <br> i said two years ago that i think we ought to aim for inflation of about [%_Number_%] percent measured by the core pce index i still think that's the case <br> i would be willing to live with shooting for [%_Number_%] percent more than any one number though i think it would be important for the federal reserve to actually explain to the public what our objectives are for inflation he said <br> additional reporting by alister bull tim ahmann and mark felsenthal
